            | In today's world, IT is one of the most important things to get right for a charity. However, not every charity can justify having a full-time software engineer on staff, most charities only need small static websites after all. It's also costly to hire developers for short contracts. We exist to help hook up volunteers and our staff to projects so that charities can focus on doing what they do best.
